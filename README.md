# MuffaloBot

This is the source code for a bot hosted on the RimWorld Discord. 



## How to self-host

Open the project using Visual Studio. Create a new resources file under the `MuffaloBot` project called `AuthResources.resx`. 

Fill in the following fields:
- `BotToken`: Your bot's token
- `SteamApiKey`: The API key for interfacing with the [Steam API](http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey).

Compile the solution as usual.

MuffaloBot targets the .NET Framework.
